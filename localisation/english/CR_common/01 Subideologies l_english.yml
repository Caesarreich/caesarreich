### Vanguardist


### Utopian Socialist
anarchism_subtype: "Anarchism"
anarchism_subtype_desc: "§Y(Anarchism)§!\n\nAnarchism is a diverse body of politics that usually calls for the total or partial erosion of the State. Seeking to organize society along other means, either through voluntary cooperation or the free association between individuals and groups, these Socialists are oftentime seen as traitors to the Revolution by mainline Leftists. Still seeking a Socialist or Communist system, just without a wider state apparatus, Anarchists reject all or most positions of authority as they pursue total egalitarianism, equality, and freedom from all gods and masters."

### Revolutionary Socialist
anarcho_syndicalism_subtype: "Anarcho-Syndicalism"
anarcho_syndicalism_subtype_desc: "§Y(Anarcho-Syndicalism)§!\n\nThe largest subset of mainline Orthodox Syndicalism, Anarcho-Syndicalism seeks to build a Syndicalist system - that is, a system organized around trade unions and employee organizations - within an Anarchist and stateless, or semi-stateless, framework. Seeking to abolish the wage system as well as Capitalist-fueled statism, Anarcho-Syndicalists believe that through solidarity, self-management, communization, direct action, and direct democracy, a true egalitarian paradise can be built for all to enjoy. Rejecting private property, hierarchies, and social stratification, Anarcho-Syndicalists will tear down the state to build their unionist utopias free from the apparent greed of statism."
agrarian_socialism_subtype: "Agrarian Socialism"
agrarian_socialism_subtype_desc: "§Y(Agrarian Socialism)§!\n\nAgrarian Socialism is the attempt to fuse Agrarian principles with Socialist doctrine. Championed by the likes of Zapata or the Narodniks, Agrarian Socialists are frequently more Conservative than their Leftist allies and push for a Socialist system that puts the peasantry and the farmers of the state above all other concerns. Common in less-developed or under-industrialized nations, Agrarian Socialism is frequently democratic, and usually calls for the creation of farming cooperatives, communes, or other cooperative organizational structures to better increase agricultural output and efficiency while progressing towards true Socialism."

### Social Democrat
socdem_christian_socialism_subtype: "Christian Socialism"
socdem_christian_socialism_subtype_desc: "§Y(Christian Socialism)§!\n\nOne of the more widespread forms of Socialism outside of the Syndicalist paradigm, especially in those countries whose populations are quite conservative and religious, Christian Socialism seeks to create a society in union with the Teachings of Jesus Christ within a Socialist framework. However, the type of Christianity and the form of Socialism each specific example follows can vary greatly."
socdem_christian_democracy_subtype: "Christian Democracy"
socdem_christian_democracy_subtype_desc: "§Y(Christian Democracy)§!\n\nChristian Democratic movements understand that only through allowing people a choice, and not coercion, a religious society might be upheld. Basing its programmes on Catholic social teaching and neo-Calvinism, Christian Democrats strive to create a free society in which traditional family values, social justice and good old fashioned patriotism will be respected. While most Christian Democratic parties don't exclude any denomination, some might choose to keep to a strictly anti-ecumenical position. Surprisingly to some, many advocates for Christian Democracy are rather left leaning in their views on the economy, advocating for models such as Distributism, based on Pope Leo XIII's 'Rerum novarum' encyclical. That position is of course not the only choice, with others preaching the Prosperity Gospel or upholding Christian Capitalism."

### Liberal
radical_liberalism_subtype: "Radical Liberalism"
radical_liberalism_subtype_desc: "§Y(Radical Liberalism)§!\n\nRadical Liberalism - also called Classical Radicalism or Radical Republicanism - describes the modern political movements chiefly inspired by the Radicals of the French Revolution and the precursor Liberals of the past century. Associated with Republicanism, modernism, civic nationalism, rationalism, secular humanism, progressivism, and more, Radical Liberal seeks to stretch the meaning of what it means to be ‘Liberal’ in order to build a truly free, fair, and egalitarian society that champions freedom, liberty, and justice for all."
venizelism_subtype: "Venizelism"
venizelism_subtype_desc: "§Y(Venizelism)§!\n\nVenizelism is one of the most significant political movements in Greece since the start of the 20th century. During the period of 1910 to 1922, when Greece was in a state of continuous military readiness, a new political mindset emerged, embodied by Eleftherios Venizelos, and was commonly referred to as Venizelism. It is difficult to define in what exactly this political ideology was, but in terms of the economy, Venizelism considered the Greek state as a lever for the expression and development of Hellenism. In other words, the Greek state had to pursue the integration of Hellenism beyond its borders and, with a unified national and state identity, claim its place in the then-modern world. This required not only institutional modernization to make the state efficient and reliable but also a general commitment to the idea of developing the nation's productive forces."

### Social Conservative

### Authoritarian Democrat
prussian_constitutionalism_subtype: "Prussian Constitutionalism"
prussian_constitutionalism_subtype_desc: "§Y(Prussian Constitutionalism)§!\n\nPrussian Constitutionalism is a semi-Authoritarian form of Parliamentary Monarchism combining ideas of enlightened monarchism and elitism supported by a limited congressional system usually modeled on the German landtag. Anti-Liberal in nature bordering on reactionary, this fusion of conservative democratic republicanism, militarism, and monarchism is the hallmark ideology of old Prussia and the Kaiserreich and is modeled on the Constiution of Germany, hence the name."
oligarchism_subtype: "Oligarchism"
oligarchism_subtype_desc: "§Y(Oligarchism)§!\n\nDuring the Gilded Age in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the United States, an oligarchy consisting of wealthy businessmen emerged as the dominant socioeconomic system. This era was characterized by the rise of powerful industrialists who amassed enormous wealth and influence through monopolistic control of critical industries such as oil, steel, and railroads. The owners of these industrial titans, known as robber barons, exercised significant control over the economy and politics, often at the expense of workers and smaller competitors. The collusion between big business and government led to widespread corruption and inequality, as a small elite wielded disproportionate power. At the same time, the majority of the population struggled with poverty and exploitation. \n\nOligarchy transcends national borders, manifesting in several fundamental principles. At its core, oligarchy entails the concentration of power and wealth in the hands of a small, privileged elite. This elite typically commands crucial industries, resources, and institutions, affording them the capacity to influence government policies and shape economic outcomes in their favor. Oligarchic systems often exhibit limited political competition, with the elite manipulating electoral processes and political institutions to preserve their grip on power. Moreover, oligarchy fosters social stratification and inequality, as wealth and opportunities increasingly cluster among the ruling class, while the majority of the population confronts economic hardship and marginalization, rendering them susceptible to state or other actors' manipulation. \n\nIn the modern world, oligarchy endures as a pervasive phenomenon, albeit with variations across nations and regions. While overt forms of oligarchic rule may have waned in some countries, subtle forms of oligarchic influence persist, shaping political, economic, and social dynamics. The globalization of capital and the interconnectivity of financial markets have empowered transnational elites to exert influence across borders, intensifying inequalities within and between countries. The erosion of democratic norms and institutions in many parts of the world has expedited the consolidation of oligarchic power, as authoritarian leaders and entrenched elites strive to preserve their dominance at the expense of democratic principles and popular participation. Consequently, the prospect of countering oligarchy remains a pressing challenge for those advocating for greater equity, justice, and democracy on a global scale."


### Paternal
absolute_mon_subtype: "Absolute Monarchy"
absolute_mon_subtype_desc: "§Y(Absolute Monarchy)§!\n\nAbsolute Monarchy holds a often despotic and authoritarian regime over the people. It is made of an autocratic king or emperor who rules over the country with an iron fist and with a powerful government under him. The government tends to be conservative with traditional values and focuses. The market, press, and businesses of the country are government controlled and the people live without a lot of their freedoms."


### Ultranationalist
legionarism_subtype: "Legionarism"
legionarism_subtype_desc: "§Y(Legionarism)§!\n\nFirst popularized by the Iron Guard of Romania, the Black Hundreds in Russia, and the ANI in Italy, Legionarism is a form of a highly religious and deeply militarist revolutionary nationalism. Rejecting entrenched political elites though sometimes tied to monarchism, Legionaries or Legionarists advocate for a national revolution that would end the old order and usher in the creation of a new, spiritually reborn society. Members of Legionary parties are often trained to act as militant martyrs in order to become closer to their Nation and God, though less extreme examples exist where Nationalism and Patriotism are expressed far more than martyrdom. In terms of economics, there is no one defined view, although Capitalism and Socialism are usually outright rejected as a corrupting, foreign force, with Corporatism, Right Syndicalism, or other forms of controlled economics largely being dominant. Though the emphasis on religion and zealotry widely differs, most Legionarists are devoutly Catholic or Christian, depending on the nation of origin, and all are deeply devoted to the jingoistic revitalization of their native country."
falangism_subtype: "Falangism"
falangism_subtype_desc: "§Y(Falangism)§!\n\nFalangism, also known as Falange, is a far-right political ideology that emerged in Spain in the early 20th century. Founded by José Antonio Primo de Rivera in 1933, it gained prominence under the dictatorship of General Francisco Franco from 1939 to 1975. Falangism combines elements of nationalism, authoritarianism, and fascism, emphasizing the unity of the nation and rejecting parliamentary democracy. It promotes a centralized government, anti-communism, and corporatist economic principles.\n\nFalangism advocates for a strong and self-sufficient Spain, upholding traditional values and Catholicism. It seeks to restore and preserve Spain's cultural heritage while rejecting Marxism and internationalism. The ideology places importance on collective unity, with individuals expected to prioritize the nation's interests over their own. It envisions a corporatist economic system where different sectors of the economy are organized into syndicates, operating under state control to achieve social and economic harmony."
metaxism_subtype: "Metaxism"
metaxism_subtype_desc: "§Y(Metaxism)§!\n\nMetaxism is a Greek nationalist authoritarian ideology associated with Ioannis Metaxas. It calls for the regeneration of the Greek nation and the establishment of a modern, culturally homogeneous Hellenic Nation. Mataxism disparages Liberalism and individualism while propagating various elements commonly found in esoteric_nationalist or National Populist movements. It seeks to mobilize the Greek people as a disciplined mass in service of the creation of a new Hellenic State. Although some of the doctrines of Metaxism are described as National Populist, academically it is considered to be a unique big tent autocratic governorship based on the personal works of Metaxas unifying ideas from classical Conservatism, Monarchism, Valkism and National Populist movements. The Idea of the Third Greek Civilization after the first ancient Greek and the second Byzantine Civilizations is the common center of the movement, which is defined differently by the various strains within Metaxism."
national_socialism_subtype: "National Socialism"
national_socialism_subtype_desc: "§Y(National Socialism)§!\n\nDespite the name, the ideology espoused by the National Social Party promotes civic nationalism, Czech patriotism, liberal reformism, and liberalized, moderated socialism in that it is immensely populist with its citizenry while seeking to establish a moderated welfare state. Denouncing Marxist ideas of Socialism and instead pushing for a reformist agenda tied to modern Capitalism, these National Socialists seek to bring liberty, prosperity, egalitarianism, and patriotism to their own people. Though mildly antisemitic in its past well before the Great War, the party and its ideology have long abandoned these venomous ideas, and push for a truly liberal and united nation for all within its borders."
